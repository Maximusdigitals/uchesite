# Atelier â€” Static Gallery

This is a static gallery site. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the images.

If you prefer to serve it with a simple local server (better for CORS/network behavior), run:

Using Python 3:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

The site loads images from Unsplash (remote). If you want the images stored locally, let me know and I can download them into an `images/` folder and update `index.html`.
